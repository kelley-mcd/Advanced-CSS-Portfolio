# Advanced-CSS-Portfolio
Homework 2
for this homework assignment we were instructed to create a portfolio.
this will follow us throughout out web dev careers and be very useful in the future when applying to jobs and showing potential employers our skills and accomplishments.
Since i am just starting out in this field, my portfolio is quite bare. 
I managed to set everything up in a way that once i have more experiance under my belt i will be able to use my portfolio as a great resource. 

below is the link to where it is published along with shreenshots of the page itself to give the reader a better idea of how it is set up.
